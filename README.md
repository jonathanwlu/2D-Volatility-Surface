# 2D Stock Volatility Surface

Plots specified stock symbol's volatility surface in 2D, days-to-expiration and strike price on the X and Y axes.  Implied volatility is represented by hot/cold color ranges in contour and hex plots.

Also includes basic plot with different colored plotlines for different volatilities.

Includes basic PyQt5 GUI to specify stock symbol.  Also includes save capability.

Requires data from database (so does not fully function as-is).

Created according to spec for summer 2017 internship at Bell Curve Capital.
